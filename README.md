# E-Commerce


In this project, we will be implementing the functionality for an ecommerce website using React and Redux, a popular state management library for JavaScript applications. The website will have a navbar that shows relevant navigation links, a page that displays all products from an API, a product detail page, a cart page, and a create page that allows users to add new products to the database. We will also implement features such as editing and deleting products, sorting products by price, and adding products to the cart.

Approach:
To implement the functionality for an ecommerce website using React and Redux, we will follow the following steps:

Plan the website functionality: Before we start coding, we need to have a clear idea of what the website should do. We will review the provided requirements to get an understanding of the functionality, including the navbar, product listing page, product detail page, cart page, and create page.

Set up the project: We will create a new project using Create React App and install the necessary dependencies, including Redux and Redux Thunk, a middleware for handling asynchronous actions in Redux.

Create the Redux store: We will create a Redux store that will hold the application state, including the list of products, the cart items, and any notifications or errors.

Build the navbar component: We will create a reusable navbar component that displays relevant navigation links and shows the number of items in the cart.

Implement the product listing page: We will fetch data from the API and display a list of products on the product listing page. Each product will have a pencil button for editing and a delete button for deleting. We will also implement a sort button that sorts products by price and a button to add a product to the cart.

Implement the product detail page: We will create a product detail page that shows all the details of a product, including images, description, and price. We will also add a button to add the product to the cart.

Implement the cart page: We will create a cart page that displays all the items in the cart and allows the user to remove items or update quantities.

Implement the create page: We will create a create page that allows users to add new products to the database. After submitting the form, we will show a notification to indicate that the product was added successfully.

Handle errors and notifications: We will handle errors from the API and show appropriate notifications to the user, such as success messages or error messages.

Style the website: Finally, we will use CSS to style the website, making it visually appealing and easy to use.
